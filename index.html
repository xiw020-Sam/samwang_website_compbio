        <h2>Research Experience</h2>
    
        <h3>Cristea Lab, Hale Family Center for Pancreatic Cancer Research</h3>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Computational Biologist (July 2024 – Current)</p>
        <p>Developing novel AI/ML transformer decoder-only large foundation language models for inferring and generating cancer evolution at the single-cell level using scRNAseq data under Dr. Simona Cristea, PhD. The work includes data aggregation using publicly available scRNAseq datasets, pseudo cell evolution progression generations from k-nearest neighbors, and constructing custom transformer models for cancer cell evolution prediction.</p>
    
        <h3>Wolpin-Nowak Lab, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute</h3>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Computational Biologist (July 2024 – Current)</p>
        <p>Collaborating with Dr. Brian Wolpin, MD, MPH, Dr. Jonathan Nowak, MD, PhD, and Dr. Andrew Aguirre, MD, PhD, on a project analyzing biomarkers and tumor micro-environments of pancreatic cancer using spatially resolved single-cell RNA sequencing data. This study involves constructing standardized pipelines for cell type annotations and tumor subtyping, and validating results with spatial information.</p>
    
        <h3>Liu Lab, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute</h3>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Graduate Student Researcher (Nov 2022 – May 2024)</p>
        <p>Focused on developing deep neural networks for inferring melanoma tumor ploidy, purity, cancer cell fractions, and heterogeneity from tumor-only targeted panel sequencing data under Dr. David Liu, MD, MPH, MS. Responsibilities included data cleaning, variant allele frequency (VAF) analysis, read depth analysis, and developing statistical models for cancer cell fraction and heterogeneity inferences.</p>
    
        <h3>Alexandrov Lab, University of California, San Diego</h3>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Undergraduate Bioinformatics Researcher (May 2021 – Aug 2022)</p>
        <p>Conducted a comprehensive benchmarking of mutational signature assignment tools under Dr. Ludmil B. Alexandrov, PhD. This involved the installation and execution of over 20 different mutational signature assignment tools, data analysis, benchmarking using synthetic datasets, and upgrading SigProfilerSingleSample, the assignment tool developed by the Alexandrov lab.</p>
    
        <h3>Masuda Lab, University of California, San Diego</h3>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Staff Research Associate (May 2022 – Aug 2022)</p>
        <p>Worked on intervertebral disc restoration using a rabbit model under Dr. Koichi Masuda, MD. Responsibilities included performing pre-operational, surgical, and post-operational procedures, and conducting 2D x-rays and 3D micro-CT post-harvesting analysis.</p>
    
        <h3>Cartilage Tissue Engineering Lab, University of California, San Diego</h3>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Undergraduate Researcher (Apr 2019 – Aug 2022)</p>
        <p>Worked on a senior design project for surgical restoration of the anterior cruciate ligament and knee biomechanics, including improving surgical techniques for ACL reconstruction using rabbit models and quantifying marine animal teeth enamel structure using micro-CT.</p>
